# Parelellism-in-Bankruptcy-Preditction
A crunch of Statistical Modelling and Classification algorithms aided through distributed computing in predicting the bankruptcy of a given company.

#Abstract
Bankruptcy prediction is a crucial problem statement prevalent in the finance sector today. With the looming recession, feds hiking up interest rates with inflation; there exists a need to assess the financial as well as liquidity health of companies with time as a crucial constraint. In recent years, a plethora of machine learning techniques used for classification have been identified in solving and predicting whether a certain company is bankrupt or not. In this project, we aim to investigate and exploit parallelism in evaluating various classification algorithms used to predict bankruptcy given a large dataset. With the size of data ever increasing, we aim to achieve speedup, high accuracy as well as efficiency by leveraging the concepts that we have learnt throughout the course. With focus on scalability, optimization and feature selection, this project explores the techniques through which parallel processing can be utilized to solve large and complex problems.
